              First, thank you for being here, as you can read pretty much
              everywhere on this website, I am Maxime Fabre, a 27 years old
              Full-Stack Web Developer. I wrote my first line of code by the end
              of February 2020 and developped a real passion about coding ever
              since! I followed a "Bootcamp / Intership" @{" "}

              oriented around the Stack MERN (JavaScript, ReactJs and
              Express/NodeJs with two little React Native mobile projects). If I
              had to define myself I would say that I'm more of a "technical
              guy", I like a complex back-end more than a beautifull front-end,
              but I think they are as important one than the other. I'm actually
              following a course from Clement Mihailescu (ex-Google Software
              Engineer) to learn complex algorithms. I love to learn and I love
              to do my best in everything I undertake.
